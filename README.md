# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR-INTERFACE
This project is a simple calculator written in Python language. This project accepts both integer and float numbers and is written in an object-oriented programming approach.

>I created this Python program because of two reasons. First, this project is a university requirement. The second and last reason, I wrote this program is to learn and explore more in the field of programming.
Project Description
This program asks the user for 2 input numbers (in order). Then the program will ask for an operation to perform on the input numbers and outputs the answer. In case of invalid input from the user, the program will print a message and will ask for the necessary input until the user types in the appropriate input. After the initial process is done, the program will ask the user if they need to use the calculator again, if yes, the program will start again and if no, the program is done.

## How to Use?

>To use this program:
>1. The user will need to download the 3 files (OPERATION.py, MAIN.py, and USERINTERFACE.py

>2. Once downloaded, user may open all three files but the main file that you will run is the file MAIN using any type of Python Integrated Development Environment or IDE and run the program.

>3. Next, once the program is running, the program will ask the user for two input numbers and an operation.


>4. The user will need to click the Process Inputs button to process the data.

>5. Ifthe user's input is not a number and is not an operation, an error message will be outputd.

>6. Once the inputs are valid, the program will show the inputted numbers, operation and the answer.
